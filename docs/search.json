    "text": "To ensure a welcoming environment for all, we require everyone participating in the course to conform to the Code of Conduct given below. This code applies to all spaces related to the course including, but not limited to, classroom, ‘aula virtual’, emails, shared documents, and code repositories. We strongly recommend that anyone running workshops or classes of any kind choose and publish a similar code so that everyone will know what is expected of them and what to do when those expectations are not met.\n\nYou can report Code of Conduct violations in person to Carlos Granell.\nWe are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognize that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.\nHarassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent.\nProhibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:\n\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation;\nthe display of sexual or violent images;\nunwelcome sexual attention;\nnon-consensual or unwelcome physical contact;\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications;\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop; and\npublication of private communication without consent.\n\nBehaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.\nEnforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.\nThank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.\n\nThis code of conduct is a simplification of the CoC for Reproducible Research workshos at AGILE, which is based on a CoC for Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson, which in turn is based on that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki."

    "text": "The course content is organized in four teaching units:\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hello!] --&gt; B(1. Intro)\n  B --&gt; C{Role?}\n  C --&gt; |reviewer| D(2. Assessment)\n  C --&gt; |author| E(3. Practices)\n  D --&gt; F(4. UJI)\n  E --&gt; F(4. UJI)\n  F --&gt; G[Extras]\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit 1 - Introduction to reproducibility: This unit is an introduction to the key terms of reproducibility and replicability across disciplines. It also offers a historical account to put reproducibility in science into perspective.\nUnit 2 - Reproducibility assessment: This unit takes the perspective of a reviewer or reader, similar to the reviewer’s role in traditional peer review, to assess the level of reproducibility of an article or research report. It gives some general evaluation criteria and puts them into practice in the field of GIScience.\nUnit 3 - Reproducibility practices and recommendations: This unit takes the perspective of a principal investigator or author, similar to the author’s role in traditional peer review, who needs practical recommendations and practices to make their next article more reproducible. In this unit we discuss a series of practices, tips and recommendations, in increasing order of complexity and technological sophistication, to integrate reproducibility into her daily research tasks. Specific practices produced by the Reproducible Research @ AGILE group are also available in the field of GIScience.\nUnit 4 - Reproducibility research at UJI: In this unit we introduce the local context of the Universitat Jaume I, as part of the Spanish research system, regarding on how open science, reproducibility, code and data sharing, and FAIR principles apply to UJI researchers. Therefore, you can skip this section and check with your host institution if similar rules and regulations apply to you.\n\nWe are pretty sure that the above units only grasp the surface of reproducible research. Depending on your needs, course length, and participant profiles, you can develop deeper certain units, add new ones focusing for example on the tech stack to support computational reproducibility, or include practical activities such as real reproduction of existing papers in your discipline."
