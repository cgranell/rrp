    "text": "To ensure a welcoming environment for all, we require everyone participating in the course to conform to the Code of Conduct given below. This code applies to all spaces related to the course including, but not limited to, classroom, ‘aula virtual’, emails, shared documents, and code repositories. We strongly recommend that anyone running workshops or classes of any kind choose and publish a similar code so that everyone will know what is expected of them and what to do when those expectations are not met.\n\nYou can report Code of Conduct violations in person to Carlos Granell.\nWe are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognize that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.\nHarassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent.\nProhibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:\n\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation;\nthe display of sexual or violent images;\nunwelcome sexual attention;\nnon-consensual or unwelcome physical contact;\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications;\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop; and\npublication of private communication without consent.\n\nBehaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.\nEnforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.\nThank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.\n\nThis code of conduct is a simplification of the CoC for Reproducible Research workshos at AGILE, which is based on a CoC for Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson, which in turn is based on that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki."

The course is not focused on a particular discipline or area of knowledge, as it is intended for participants with varied backgrounds. Specific aspects in this course, if any, are applied to GIScience. Concepts and terms related to GIScience and/or open science are linked, where possible, to concepts from the GIS&T Body of Knowledge and/or EO4GEO Body of Knowledge.\nIf you are an educator, you may start by exploring the teaching units and technology stack sections a little before jumping directly into the course units. Although there are no sections on design principles or pedagogical approach, because the course is a brief but practical introduction based solely on my previous experience, the set of teaching units may be useful for your needs.\nIf you are a learner, you might consider jumping straight into the next section to identify yourself as one of the learner persona."

Assessment)\n  C --&gt; |author| E(3. Practices)\n  D --&gt; F(4. UJI)\n  E --&gt; F(4. UJI)\n  F --&gt; G[Extras]\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit 1 - Introduction to reproducibility: This unit is an introduction to the key terms of reproducibility and replicability across disciplines. It also offers a historical account to put reproducibility in science into perspective.\nUnit 2 - Reproducibility assessment: This unit takes the perspective of a reviewer or reader, similar to the reviewer’s role in traditional peer review, to assess the level of reproducibility of an article or research report. It gives some general evaluation criteria and puts them into practice in the field of GIScience.\nUnit 3 - Reproducibility practices and recommendations: This unit takes the perspective of a principal investigator or author, similar to the author’s role in traditional peer review, who needs practical recommendations and practices to write their next article in a reproducible manner. In this unit we discuss a series of practices, tips and recommendations, in increasing order of complexity and technological sophistication, to integrate reproducibility into your daily research tasks. Specific practices produced by the Reproducible Research @ AGILE group are also available in the field of GIScience.\nUnit 4 - Reproducibility research at UJI: In this unit we introduce the local context of the Universitat Jaume I, as part of the Spanish research system, regarding on how open science, reproducibility, code and data sharing, and FAIR principles apply to UJI researchers. Therefore, you can skip this section if you are not affiliated with UJI and check with your host institution if similar rules and regulations apply to you.\n\nWe are pretty sure that the units above only grasp the surface of reproducible research. Depending on your needs, course length, and participant profiles, you, as a educator, can develop certain units in greater depth, add new ones focusing, for example, on the technology stack to support computational reproducibility, or include practical activities such as actual reproduction of existing papers in your discipline.\nAs a learner, you have many articles, web sites and documents to expand your knowledge and curiosity about reproducibility research 😀."

I do not have enough time”, and “I do theoretical stuff. Reproduction is not for me”\nNo matter your excuse; If you do not want to fool yourself, reproducible research practices are essential to enable not only reproducible but transparent, open and honest science. Indeed, conducting reproducible research is neither overly difficult nor does it require encyclopedic knowledge of multiple research tools, standards, and protocols. The good news is that most researchers already do much of the work necessary to make research reproducible. The point here is then to identify those aspects that could improve the level of reproducibility of your research and adapt them to your workflow and research habits.\nYou should ask yourself:"

    "text": "Key guidelines\nThere are excellent practical guides with general recommendations for promoting reproducibility, research data management and open science. As an author, who wants to integrate reproducibility research practices into her next research paper, the following resources are an excellent starting point:\n\nThe British Ecological Society publishes brief guidelines for conducting open science on ecology but applicable to any discipline. Among them, the guide Reproducible code (Cooper and Hsing 2019) explains organizational and managerial aspects for making software code more reproducible.\nPassport for Open Science: A Practical Guide for PhD Students (Berti et al. 2022) explains how the principles of open science can be applied to doctoral research. The proposed practices are applicable to any discipline and, although focused on doctoral students, they are aimed at any researcher regardless of their previous experience.\nA Beginner’s Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research (Alston and Rick 2021) is a very concise, practical guide to apply reproducible practices to a research project.\nThe Turing Way is indeed a compendium of guides on open science, reproducibility, and research ethics, among other interesting topics. Have a look at the Guide for Reproducible Research (The Turing Way Community 2019).\nReproducible Publications at AGILE Conferences: Guidelines for Authors, Scientific Reviewers, and Reproducibility Reviewers (Nust et al. 2020) describes specific aspects to write conference papers in the field of GIScience."

Note that most of the following recommendations are already widely accepted best practices for scientific research and that striving for a reasonable level of reproducibility is more achievable than you may expect. Essentially, researchers must think carefully before, during, and after analysis to ensure the reproducibility, openness and transparency of their work."
