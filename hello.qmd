Hello!
And welcome!

There is a little bit of something for everyone (who wants to teach/learn) reproducible research practices. The course is not focused on a particular discipline or area of knowledge, as it is intended for participants with varied backgrounds. Specific aspects, if any, applied to GIScience.

If you are an educator, you may start by exploring the teaching units and technology stack sections a little before jumping directly into the course units Although there are no sections on design principles or pedagogical approach, because the course is a brief but practical introduction based solely on my previous experience, the series of teaching units may be useful for your needs.

If you are a learner, you might consider jumping straight into the next section to identify yourself as one of the learner persona.
