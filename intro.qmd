title: "Introduction to Reproducibility and Replicability"
---

We look at landmark examples that have influenced the emphasis on reproducibility in the past decades and explain why reproducibility is so important in current scientific endeavour. 

We highlight which components may be reproducible and take a PhD perspective for reproducibility too. Next, we start with the Reproduction Plan by assessing the reproducibility criteria over research papers.
