title: Reproducibility vs. replicability across disciplines
---

This table compares the concepts of reproducibility and replicability between different disciplines, to highlight slightly different interpretations between communities. [@barba2018] discusses different interpretations of the terms reproducibility and replicability across disciplines, authors, and stakeholder groups.
