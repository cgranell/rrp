# What is the scientific method? {background-color="#4f6952"}


## Popper's *conjectures and refutations*

### Science progresses through [*conjectures and refutations*](https://joelvelasco.net/teaching/hum9/popper-conjecturesrefutations.pdf) 

::: {.incremental}

-   Scientists are confronted with some question, and offer an answer (**conjecture**), which might be right or wrong

-   Scientists do their best to **refute** it, or prove it wrong

-   Typically it is refuted, rejected, and replaced by a better one

    -   And tested over and over...

-   If scientists have not been able to refute a theory over a long period of time, then the theory is **corroborated**

## Newton's request for raw data

In 1695, Sir Isaac Newton wrote a letter to the British Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed, whose data on lunar positions he was trying to get for more than half a year...

>  "Today, few published results are reproducible in any practical sense. To verify them requires almost as much effort as it took to create them originally. After a time, *authors are often unable to reproduce their own results!* For these reasons, many people ignore most of the literature. but with standards for Fortran, C, UNIX, Latex, postcript, Xwindows, CD-ROM [...], *there is no longer any excuse for nonreproducible research*. It is time to plunge into this new era."

-   Rubén Herzog, Universidad de Valparaíso in Chile, published a 2020 [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74060-6) in Scientific Reports

-   Paul Lodder, a grad student at the University of Amsterdam, wanted to expand on Rubén's model 

-   Paul reproduced the analysis results from the article before looking into how to expand it...

-   ...but Paul got **different results!**

> "Because I [Paul] was able to run his code and mine on the same simulated data, it was very clear that the typo caused the results from the paper. I shared my results with Rubén in a written report and he quickly got back to me. He acknowledged that this was indeed an error and thanked me for trying to reproduce his results. He also invited me as a co-author for the resubmission, by which I am truly honored."

## Is “science is in crisis” narrative wrong?

> The new “science is in crisis” narrative is not only empirically unsupported, but also quite obviously counterproductive. *Instead of inspiring younger generations to do more and better science, it might foster in them cynicism and indifference*. Instead of inviting greater respect for and investment in research, it risks discrediting the value of evidence and feeding antiscientific agendas.

## Is “science is in crisis” narrative wrong?

> Therefore, contemporary science could be more accurately portrayed as facing “new opportunities and challenges” or even a “revolution”. *Efforts to promote transparency and reproducibility would find complete justification in such a narrative of transformation and empowerment*, a narrative that is not only more compelling and inspiring than that of a crisis, but also better supported by evidence.
